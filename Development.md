# Development

This file is the instructions on setting up a Unity Environment
to be able ot edit and change the project.

# 1. Unity Setup

Using [LTS Release 2020.3.2f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.2)
* Including build support for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Install this version of Unity from Unity Hub
* Here are instructions how to install and setup Unity Hub [instructions link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html)
* If this link for Unity Hub does not work try using the downloads provided on [this forum page](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-hub-v-1-3-2-is-now-available.594139/) This will also have a download for Linux.
* This should work for linux, if not here is a supplemental article on setting up unity hub in linux. [article link](https://www.linuxdeveloper.space/install-unity-linux/)

Before you can use Unity hub, you need to setup a license
* If you are a student or using this for a personal project, you can get a personal license.
* If you do not qualify for a personal license use your company license.
* For more information about licenses, please check [Unity's License Page](https://store.unity.com/compare-plans)

Install the proper version of Unity from UnityHub using this unity hub link [unityhub://2020.3.2f1/8fd9074bf66c](unityhub://2020.3.2f1/8fd9074bf66c)
* Note, UnityHub must be registered on your system for it to open the Unity Hub App.
* To do this in linux, just launch the downloaded `UnityHub.AppImage` file.

# 1.1 Install Related Tools

In order to fully load and edit the project, you must have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) version 2.8 or more recent. 
Download for Blender can be found [here](https://www.blender.org/download/). Blender is an open source 
piece of software used for 3d modeling, animation, and texturing (as well as many other features). 

# 2. Setting Up the Project
Now that the proper version of unity has been installed, open the project with UnityHub.
In order to do this, you must first clone the repo:

```bash
# This can be anywhere you want to store the project
$ cd ~/projects
# Download the git repo
$ git clone git@github.com:nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt-Mirror.git
# If you do not have ssh key setup, you can download via https
$ git clone https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt-Mirror.git
```

# 3. Version Control
Version Control: This project uses a combination of git, git-lfs, and github.

Ensure that you have git installed. If not here is a [guide to install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
```
git --version
```

Ensure that you also have git lfs installed. It should be setup to auto-track certain types of files as determined in the `.gitattributes` file. If the command to install git-lfs `git lfs install` is giving you trouble, try looking into the [installation guide](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
```bash
# Run this inside the repository after cloning it
# May need to run this on linux
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

## 3.1 GitHooks Setup

Once git-lfs is installed, you can setup the githooks for the project from the `.githooks` directory. In order to do this, use the following command to reconfigure the `core.hooksPath` for your repository
```bash
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This will setup the tools. Ensure you also complete step 5.1 to properly install dotnet. The tool `dotnet format` will be automatically installed and used to check and verify the formatting of your C# files when working with the project using settings form the `.editorconfig` file in the repository. If you want to install dotnet format before making a commit, use the command `dotnet restore` from the base of the repository and it will install the tool.

# 4. Opening the Project

After you have downloaded the git repo, launch unity hub and navigate to the `Projects` section on the
menu on the left half of the screen. 

![Unity Hub Projects Screen with highlights around the projects and add buttons](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hJgtwej_AGCw9ASVkFL6hH-VzF3Mopya)

From this file menu, navigate to the folder where the
project has been downloaded. For example 
`~/projects/PropHunt-Mirror`. Then hit the `Open` 
button in the file selector.

![Selecting Project from file selector](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XbxAoZ4ISadUDGPs6bxxQUUxYnxXlLOa)

After the environment has a chance to load, the project 
should be listed in the projects area as shown in the image
below.

# 5. Coding Environment

## 5.1 Languages

Languages: [C#](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html)

The compilers for these are included in Unity but having the `.NET Core SDK` is required for the IDE. Instructions to install `.NET Core SDK`: [Installation Instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/sdk-for-vs-code?utm_source=vs-code&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sdk-install). There should be a `.exe` for windows, a set of commands for linux or mac. 
* **Note** If you are installing for linux, ensure that you have the mono libraries installed. Mono Libraries: [https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable)
* **Additional Note** You may need to reboot the computer after installing the `.NET Core SDK`.

Also make sure to be using .NET 4.x compatibility in Unity. This will allow for full use
of libraries and other features. For more information on how to do this, follow 
Microsoft's guide to switch [Unity to .NET 4.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/unity-scripting-upgrade?view=vs-2019).

## 5.2 Enabling the .NET 4.x Scripting Runtime in Unity

To enable the .NET 4.x scripting runtime, take the following steps:

1. Open PlayerSettings in the Unity Inspector by selecting `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings`.
2. Under the Configuration heading, click the Scripting Runtime Version dropdown and select .NET 4.x Equivalent. You will be prompted to restart Unity.

![Menu to setup changes](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15EWdxaH7x5OWRXiQlcwUo-2q-8WKn0jv)

From Microsoft's article ([Unity to .NET 4.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/unity-scripting-upgrade?view=vs-2019))

## 5.3 Adding New Libraries

If you wish to add new .NET libraries to the project, See Microsoft's page on [Using .NET 4.x in Unity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/unity-scripting-upgrade?view=vs-2019#taking-advantage-of-net-compatibility)
and the sub section of "taking advance of .NET compatibility".
You simply have to add the `.dll` file from the 
project package archive. Instructions on how to get this and
implement these changes are in the article linked above. 

# 6. IDE

The IDE we are using is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Make sure that you have the `.NET Core SDK` installed. [Installation Instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/sdk-for-vs-code?utm_source=vs-code&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sdk-install). (See earlier section [Languages](#Languages) for more information)

To add VSCode as Unity's default editor, select it under: `Edit > Preferences > External Tools > External Script Editor`. 

# 7. Switching Unity IDE to VSCode

    Software (because Nick can't spell and properly spelled comments are great).

# 9. Coding Style

As far as coding style, please try to stay consistent with [C# Coding Guidelines](https://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Csharp_Coding_Guidelines) from Unity's reference guide. 
There is a tool in the repo installed as part of the githooks called `dotnet format` that will verify the style of your code with every commit and whenever you make a pull request to the github repository.

# 10. Known Issues

* If your unity fails to open the project during import, it may be due to having the packages locked. To fix this try closing Unity and the IDE (most likely VS Code or Visual Studio) and re-open the project. After the project loads you can open the project and IDE without issue.
* If your unity fails to run on the scenes with an error about assets, models, meshes, or prefabs, it may be due to not having the required libraries installed. Make sure you have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installed (v2.8 or greater). Make sure that you restart your machine after installing Blender.
