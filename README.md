# PropHunt Mirror

This is a project to learn how to use [Mirror Networking](https://mirror-networking.com/) with Unity and create a simple game modeled off of PropHunt. 
This project is based on the [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) game mode [PropHunt (Hide'n'Seek)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135509255).
